This was deployed thanks to [Thomas Wang](https://github.com/thomaswangio/gatsby-personal-starter-blog), and is using a modified fork of Gatsby Starter Blog and using the Gatsby Starter Netlify CMS.

## ðŸŽ“ Learning Gatsby

Looking for more guidance? Full documentation for Gatsby lives [on the website](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). Here are some places to start:

- **For most developers, we recommend starting with our [in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/).** It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process.

- **To dive straight into code samples, head [to our documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/).** In particular, check out the _Guides_, _API Reference_, and _Advanced Tutorials_ sections in the sidebar.

## ðŸ“” Learning Netlify CMS with Gatsby

Start from [this point](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/sourcing-from-netlify-cms/#authenticating-with-github) in the Gatsby documentation to finish the set up for your personal Netlify CMS with authentication.
