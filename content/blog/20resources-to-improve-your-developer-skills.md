Put a group of developers in a room together. Can you judge their skill level based on their introductions? 

At the [Mentorship Saturdays][1] events (where I used to co-host), it was common to hear things like: 

  * I&#8217;m a CS graduate, but we actually never did any coding.
  * I&#8217;ve been a developer for 15 years. But I was mostly working on servers and databases.
  * I graduated out of a bootcamp, and can build some websites and apps. I don&#8217;t know much backend.

First &#8212; THIS IS TOTALLY NORMAL. Developers is a catch-all term.   
Second &#8212; As a developer, you will always be learning. Growth and development should be your mantra. 

In this post, I&#8217;ll be covering learning material to help you accelerate your own developer journey.

## The Price of Education

Some may say that education is priceless, as whatever you learn can make you valuable in the future. But my $40k college debt going for animation will laugh at you.

While there are some great free resources, there may be a price tag to some of them. Because frankly, education is still a buyers market. 

Overall, there are some reasonably affordable education out there. ($20 a month? I spent $20 for dinner last night!)

And I encourage you to supplement your FREE training with PAID stuff to get a well-rounded education. (For example: Using Freecodecamp, but also buying 3-4 books, and a subscription service.)

## Online Training

These are full classes that provide a start-to-finish way of learning.  


### Wes Bos&#8217; JS30 Challenge (Free)

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <p>
    Beginner to Intermediate developers and designers who want to become comfortable with both JavaScript fundamentals and working in the DOM without a library.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You should already know some JavaScript to start &#8211; This isn&#8217;t a JavaScript 101 course. We learn by application &#8211; encountering many new situations while talking about the hows, the whys and the whats that we use to solve them.<br />
  </p>
  
  <p>
    We steer clear of opinionated design patterns, frameworks, libraries and any type of abstraction. These things are great and often needed, but can obstruct learning and constrain initial understanding.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    These tutorials rely heavily upon browser APIs, most of which involve interaction with the page. If you are stuck in <code>console.log()</code>&nbsp;land, these videos are your next step. Oh, the stuff we build is really fun!

### Khan Academy&#8217;s Computer Science Track (Free)

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <p>
    What are algorithms and why should you care? We&#8217;ll start with an overview of algorithms and then discuss two games that you could use an algorithm to solve more efficiently &#8211; the number guessing game and a route-finding game.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Then, the track goes into cryptography, information theory, how computers work, and additional information on how the internet works.

## Online Resources

These are resources that help you in a specific situation.

### Big O Notation

There&#8217;s a lot of resources to explain Big O.

### 30 Seconds of Code

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <p>
    The core goal of <strong>30 seconds of code</strong>&nbsp;is to provide a quality resource for beginner and advanced JavaScript developers alike. We want to help improve the JavaScript ecosystem, by lowering the barrier of entry for newcomers and help seasoned veterans pick up new tricks and remember old ones. In order to achieve this, we have collected hundreds of snippets that can be of use in a wide range of situations. We welcome new contributors and we like fresh ideas, as long as the code is short and easy to grasp in about 30 seconds. The only catch, if you may, is that a few of our snippets are not perfectly optimized for large, enterprise applications and they might not be deemed production-ready.

### Elegant Javascript by Marijn Haverbeke 

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <p>
    This is a book about instructing computers. Computers are about as common as screwdrivers today, but they are quite a bit more complex, and making them do what you want them to do isn’t always easy.<br />If the task you have for your computer is a common, well-understood one, such as showing you your email or acting like a calculator, you can open the appropriate application and get to work. But for unique or open-ended tasks, there probably is no application.<br />That is where programming may come in. <em>Programming</em> is the act of constructing a <em>program</em>—a set of precise instructions telling a computer what to do. Because computers are dumb, pedantic beasts, programming is fundamentally tedious and frustrating.

### The Tech Interview Handbook

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <p>
    What is this?<br /> Carefully curated content to help you ace your next technical interview, with a focus on algorithms. System design questions are in-progress.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <br /> Why do I want this?<br /> This repository has practical content that covers all phases of a technical interview, from applying for a job to passing the interviews to offer negotiation. Technically competent candidates might still find the non-technical content helpful as well.<br />
  </p>
  
  <p>
    How is this repository different?<br /> There are many awesome books like Cracking the Coding Interview and interview-related repositories out there on GitHub, what makes this repository different? The difference is that many existing interview repositories contain mainly links to external resources whereas this repository contains top quality curated content directly for your consumption.
