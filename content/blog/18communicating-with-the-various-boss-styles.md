In the book, [The Synergist,][1] the author Les McKeown defines 3 natural leadership styles. 

  * **Visionary** &#8211; has big dreams, big ideas. Think of the leader who has a end goal, but doesn&#8217;t really care for the details.
  * **Operator** &#8211; actively works on the details. Think of that leader who is also part of the team. Like a lean dev team, where the lead is coding as well. 
  * **Processor** &#8211; documents processes, to define future success. Think of project managers who can migrate between multiple teams. 

It&#8217;s uncommon to be completely have one leadership style. For most leaders, you may be predominately one style, while having bits of the other styles. Such as: 75% Type A, and 25% type B. 

There&#8217;s actually a 4th leadership style, called a **Synergist**, whose goal is to align the team with all three types. But that&#8217;s not important for the sake of this blog post.

No leadership style is better than the other &#8211; and a well-oiled team often has all the leadership styles complimenting each other.

## So what does this mean?

Understanding the leadership style will help with communication in the workplace. 

<u>Let&#8217;s go through each leadership style</u> ****

**Visionaries:** Visionaries think about the big picture. They like to think backwards. Steve Jobs had a idea of how he wanted the iPhone to act/how it feels. He has a &#8216;I&#8217;ll know it when I see it&#8217; mentality, and often berating his team for not knowing how to read his mind. 

Visionaries are not as crazy as Steve Jobs. Having a Visionary is important to defining a goal, and being the final voice of a project. 

Talking to Visionaries in details will have them look at you with glazed eyes. Instead, you want to discuss how the &#8216;whatever&#8217; affects their end goal. 

**Operators**: Operators prefer to just GO. You may be familiar that that quote: _&#8220;[the best way to_ **_eating an elephant_**_&nbsp;can only be done one&nbsp;_**_way_**_: one bite at a time.&#8221;_ While Visionaries think of big plans, Operators go do it. 

Operators are important because sometimes, you just need to act. If there is a project due tomorrow &#8211; the Operator leadership style will organize their team to tackle it head first. They may not document it, and they may not know what will happen at the end &#8211; but it&#8217;ll be figured out and solved. 

Talking to Operators with plans and procedures will bore them. Instead, give them a big picture goal, and a timeline of what&#8217;s going to happen and your next steps. 

**Processors**: Processors prefer to spend time thinking and creating plans. If a Visionary is defining the end-goal, and the Operator is doing the work, then a Processor is documenting the process. 

Processors make sure all the i&#8217;s are dotted and the t&#8217;s are crossed. They don&#8217;t like unknowns. In fact, they like that you thought things through. So giving them all the details will help them. They need to know everything with their projects, to ensure it&#8217;s going smoothly. 

Talking to Processors with vague answers will only annoy them. Instead, sit down with them and unpack everything in your head. 

## Dealing with the various types of leaders with Framing

Framing is one of the key elements you need when explaining something to your higher-ups.

**Let&#8217;s use my own mom &#8212;**

My mother is not very tech savvy. But let&#8217;s say her smart phone&#8217;s screen is too dim, and she can&#8217;t figure it out why. 

  * **Wrong framing:** &#8220;Mom, just visit your phone settings, and adjust the display settings. Adjusting the brightness setting will fix that.&#8221;
  * **Right framing:** &#8220;Mom, slide your finger from the top to the center. There&#8217;s a sun thing with a bar. Move that bar around and it should get brighter.&#8221; 

As mentioned, she&#8217;s not tech savvy at all, and talking about settings will confuse her. 

I&#8217;m aware that this example is a bit silly.

Yet we do that all the time with our own managers! 

Let&#8217;s go through an example of Framing, and how to explain it better based on the various leadership styles. 

## Framing the issue with the Leadership Styles

_This is a hypothetical situation. There&#8217;s other factors like their tech expertise, their style of how to consume information and what they actually need to know to their goal._

**The Problem:** The server is down. 

  * **Explaining it to a Visionary**: (big picture) &#8220;The goal was to block hacks to our site, and because of a bad software deploy, it took the server down for a bit of time. We are back up, and will have future plans in place to mitigate future outage times.‚Äù

  * **Explaining it to a Operator:** (what you did to solve it) &#8220;When the server went down, my team were alerted and went into action. We checked the settings, found out it was a misconfigured rule within the Web Application Firewall, and disabled the rule for now. We&#8217;ll be checking the status over the next few days and fix things as needed.&#8221;

  * **Explaining it to a Processor:** (your thinking) &#8220;The server went down because we had a misconfigured rule within the Web Application Firewall during a routine deployment. The goal of blocking inline JavaScript that is used in attacks. Here was our thought process&#8230; [detailed notes].&#8221;

Without short of having them take the Synergist quiz, the next best thing is seeing how they prefer information. Identifying their style will help you craft your future conversations.
