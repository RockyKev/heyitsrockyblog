I had a coworker who was always incredibly busy. 

She would complain about how much work needed to be done. 

I remember asking her about her day. And she would rattle off everything on her todo list. 

One thing stood out. She mentioned how it took her **30 minutes to go grocery shopping every single day**.

I looked at her and asked, &#8220;Wait, why are you shopping for groceries **every single day**?&#8221;

And she looked at me like I was crazy, like I was a idiot for asking. Her response, &#8220;How else am I supposed to eat?&#8221; 

<hr class="wp-block-separator" />

If you&#8217;re not paying attention, you&#8217;ll know that there&#8217;s absolutely NO REASON to go grocery shopping every day. Instead of spending 30 minutes shopping per day (3.5 hours a week), why not just spend 2 hours shopping per week?

You may be laughing at the whole concept, that she wasn&#8217;t able to step back and realize how inefficient her grocery shopping task is. 

But let&#8217;s step back even further, and point the spotlight on you.

How often do you check email? Once an hour? 

Let&#8217;s say it takes you 10 minutes to check email. That&#8217;s five minutes to check it, and five minutes to respond to people. In a work day, that&#8217;s roughly 80 minutes of checking email, or more than 1/8 of your work day. Not to mention the [mental cost of resuming whatever you were working on][1].

If you took a step back, how could you make that more efficient? Maybe you check email once or twice a day. Maybe it&#8217;s time-blocking very specific times to check email.

Take a step back and review your own habits and todo lists. Batching tasks, and eliminating unnecessary work will open more time in your day, and even save your sanity.
