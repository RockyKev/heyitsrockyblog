I frequently have to build tools for others on my team. 

It&#8217;s something I enjoy doing. 

If I can make their lives easier and more efficient, it makes everything easier. 

  * They&#8217;ll have more bandwidth to more fulfilling work.
  * They&#8217;ll feel more energized not having to do mundane tasks.
  * They&#8217;ll learn about new options that they never saw before.

It&#8217;s win-win.

## Not every Tool has to be technical

Not every tool has to be some custom code written in a weekend in React.

The one &#8216;tool&#8217; that comes to mind was in my game developer days. Our writer wanted to see the text in game, but she didn&#8217;t want to learn how to push a new build to see how her text looks &#8211; out of fear of breaking it. (Don&#8217;t even get me started on explaining branching to her)

So I put together a bunch of screenshots in Powerpoint, and simulated how the text can look like in the game &#8211; and it became our &#8216;text simulator tool&#8217;.

I&#8217;ve also built code generators using Excel and the [CONCATENATE][1] function. 

For example: HTML pages have a specific pattern to them. A header, a body, and a footer. Once you identify the patterns, you can quickly create quick and dirty tools to make their lives easier. 

And isn&#8217;t that what computers are about? To make our lives easier?
