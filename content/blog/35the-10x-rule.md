If you’re not familiar with The 10X Rule (based on the book by Grant Cardone), it states that: 

  1. you should set targets for yourself that are 10X greater than what you believe you can achieve 
  2. The biggest mistake most people make in life is not setting goals high enough.
  3. you should take actions that are 10X greater than what you believe is necessary to achieve your goals. 

NOTE: This is not to be confused with the [10x developer][1], a mythical creature who can produce 10 times the output of the average developer. 

Following these rules won&#8217;t slowly turn you into a 10x person. 
  
The misconception is that it’s not about 10x-ing. It&#8217;s about breaking what you think is possible.

Let me share an anecdote: 

The 4-minute mile was an impossible feat. &#8220;It&#8217;s not humanly possible…&#8221;, scientists would say. That was until May 6, 1954, when Roger Bannister, busted through the four-minute barrier with a time of three minutes, fifty-nine and four-tenths of a second.

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <p>
    When Bannister broke the mark, even his most ardent rivals breathed a sigh of relief. At last, somebody did it! And once they saw it could be done, they did it too. Just 46 days Bannister’s feat, John Landy, an Australian runner, not only broke the barrier again, with a time of 3 minutes 58 seconds. Then, just a year later, three runners broke the four-minute barrier in a single race. Over the last half century, more than a thousand runners have conquered a barrier that had once been considered hopelessly out of reach.

In other words &#8211; people only do what they think is possible. They limit their thinking. 

Imagine that a marathon is coming up, and you wanted to participate. But you tell yourself, &#8220;I can only run a mile before I get tired.&#8221; If you practice every day just running 1 mile &#8212; Do you think you&#8217;ll make it through that marathon? 

What if you shifted to practice to running 10 miles instead. (10x-ing it.) You definitely won&#8217;t make it to 10 miles on the first practice. You might not even make it 10 miles on marathon day. And that&#8217;s okay. 

But when someone asks, you might shift your answer to, &#8220;I can run a clean 6 miles before getting tired.&#8221;

By aiming for 10x… you push yourself and instead magnified your ability by 6 times.

That’s the point. 

## The wrong way to think about 10x

The 10x rule is an easy concept using fitness examples. You can always push your body. But how exactly can you use the 10x rule in projects?

Of course! But it’s about “how” you think of it.

We’ve all heard that story. You can’t get 9 pregnant mothers to make a baby in one month. Or [Brook’s Law][3], where adding more programmers makes a project take longer.

Those two examples are not accurate. 

It’s not about using the 10x rule to SOLVE a problem. It’s about using the 10x rule to think outside of the box and discover opportunities to optimize or push harder.

## The right way to think about 10x

1) Identify a 10x goal. Something that you know is impossible.
  
2) Ask yourself: what is the process of doing that?
  
3) Ask why: why does it have to be that particular way?

Let’s use an example.

### The Example: The 10x writer

Let’s say a writer wanted to 10x it. 

The physical limitation of this writer is that they can only write 1,000 words an hour.
  
The mental limitation of this writer is that they can only crank out 2 hours a day before their writing becomes gibberish. 

To get a 100,000-page book at first draft, that would take about 50 days of output. 
  
Add proofing & fixes, the publisher edits and revisions, and the final polish, we’re looking at an extra 30 days. So our writer can probably publish this book in about 80 days. 

Instead of 80 days, let’s say the writer wants to finish this book in 8 days. 10x it. 

What is the process of doing that?
  
The writer has to figure out how to cram 100 hours of writing in 8 days, along with the proofing/edits/polishes.

Why does it have to be that way?
  
Now we’re getting deep into it. Why exactly does the writer have to commit to all that time?

### Working backward

Let’s work backward. 8 Days. 
  
1 day to do polishes.
  
1 day to commit edits. 
  
1 day for the publisher to proofread and review.

That leaves 5 days of writing power. 
  
With 100 hours of writing to cram in five days &#8211; what are some workarounds?

Our writer could write for 20 hours straight every day for five days. (And suffer greatly)

Another alternative &#8211; 
  
Our writer can hire 5 freelancers who can contribute 20 hours each. 

Let’s break that down even more.

  1. Our writer hires 5 freelancers.
  2. For those freelancers to work, they need something to work with. So our writer spends a whole day mapping out the whole book in bullet points and story beats and leaves each freelancer to take a section. 
  3. The freelancers work hard on their sections. 
  4. At the end of the day, the writer spends their mental energy reviewing the writing to make sure it aligns with their work, and connecting any loose elements. 

**Some questions:**    
Can the writer meet the 8-day goal that they set out to do? Absolutely!  


What about the quality? Overall &#8211; freelancers could be terrible. If that’s the situation &#8211; add more freelancers or time.    


Will the book be any good? Probably not. There are probably loopholes everywhere that require a good eye to fix. 

<hr class="wp-block-separator" />

After 8 days, there’s a potential book. And if the writer chooses to, they can spend more time polishing.
  
So rather than spending 80 days working on a book, they got it down to 15-20+ days. While the writer didn’t get to 10x, they got pretty darn close. And that’s the point!

You might be saying: This is all hypothetical.

I would say &#8211; there are [writing studios that follow this method][4] that have published hundreds of books, including NY Times bestsellers.

## Other industries

10x works for fitness. 10x works for writing.

10x even works for TV shows. [South Park is produced in 6 days][5].

It also works for building online education. It’s how my team built courses quickly and effectively.
