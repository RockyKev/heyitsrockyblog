At one job, I asked my boss if we can switch form software. The current Form software was expensive, overly complex, and was an enterprise-level software that was slow to make any updates. This other software had a cleaner interface, had modern features that made my life easier and was built by a hungry start-up who was open to innovation.

I thought it was a no-brainer. To my surprise, she wrote back with those magic words, &#8220;It&#8217;s not in the budget right now.  


How often have you heard that statement?

## Maybe it&#8217;s not about software.

Maybe it&#8217;s about switching to a new technology stack. Maybe it&#8217;s asking for an upgrade to your office workstation. Or maybe it&#8217;s about **asking for that well-deserved raise**.

Maybe it&#8217;s none of those &#8211; but a freelance client who you&#8217;re working for, and you want to change their archaic technology with something that can allow you to do your job faster. 

## How it can also look like

Some other versions of this may be:  


  * Not right now.
  * I don&#8217;t see how this will work.
  * Let&#8217;s push it to [some vague future].
  * Right now, we have other priorities.

## What it means

&#8220;It&#8217;s not in the budget right now&#8221; is code for &#8220;the expense doesn&#8217;t match the value/impact&#8221;.  


Let&#8217;s start with the first thing:   


**It&#8217;s NEVER about the budget.** 

Using yourself as an example: If you had a live-death situation where you had to gather $10,000 in a week, you wouldn&#8217;t say, &#8220;It&#8217;s not in the budget.&#8221; 

You&#8217;ll have to cut some expenses, dip into savings, take a loan or two. You have to make a trade-off.  


Every business has to make trade-offs. It&#8217;s a fact of life.  


Going back to my form software request &#8212;

Do they want to spend $500 on a new form of software (when we already have to form software?) Or is that money better to be given to something else that could be more valuable?  


That&#8217;s the decision the company has to make.

## So how to do you frame your proposal?

What does the method usually look like?  


<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <p>
    <strong>STEP 1: </strong>You make the proposal. (I want this software… or I want a raise.)<br /><strong>STEP 2: </strong>The decision-maker makes a decision. (&#8220;Not in the budget.&#8221;)<br />
  </p>
</blockquote>

The problem with this process is that it relies on the decision-maker to understand what you want, and how to interpret it.   


Remember that there are multiple stakeholders in that conversation. It is NOT a battle between you and your boss. Nor is it a battle between you and the company. It&#8217;s a battle of priorities and benefits.

A better method will look like this:

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <p>
    <strong>STEP 1: </strong>Identify the stakeholders involved.<br /><strong>STEP 2: </strong>Research what your proposal can bring to the company in terms of value.<br /><strong>STEP 3: </strong>Note any solutions and unknowns.<br /><strong>STEP 4: </strong>You make the proposal. (I want this software… here&#8217;s why.)<br /><strong>STEP 5: </strong>The higher-up makes a much more informed decision.
  </p>
</blockquote>

  
This method allows you to control the narrative, and supply all the information you need. 

## Breaking it down

<hr class="wp-block-separator" />

### STEP 1: Identify the stakeholders involved.  


Stakeholders are the people that are implicated in the decision. Think through who your proposal affects.   


Using my Form software example &#8212;   


Identifying the stakeholders at a surface level:

  * Me, since it allows me to do my job faster.
  * My boss, who makes the decision.

But if I think through it at a deeper level: 

  * Some coworkers may use it.
  * There&#8217;s the CFO. My boss has to explain to the CFO why we are paying for TWO form software services.
  * Finally, there&#8217;s the Ops Team/IT team who has to figure out what this new &#8216;thing&#8217; is about. 

By spending a bit of time thinking through it &#8211; I&#8217;ve discovered the pool of stakeholders increase! I now have to think through not just the benefits with my boss, but the benefits to my coworkers, the CFO, and the Ops team who are all implicated.

<hr class="wp-block-separator" />

### STEP 2: Research what your proposal can bring to the company in terms of value.  


In this step, we are figuring out how it benefits &#8216;THE COMPANY&#8217;. So while you are part of the company, it&#8217;s important to also explain what other opportunities may be available from this proposal for everyone involved, including your stakeholders.    
Things to include: 

  * Use cases or testimonials (Customer feedback)
  * Any promises or guarantees (30-day money backs, 24-hour response time, or even built-in templates) 
  * Any borrowed value (Something like, &#8220;This is what Google uses&#8221; is borrowing from Google&#8217;s decision making, which may turn the favor to you.)
  * 

Using my Form software example &#8212; 

  1. By allowing me to work faster in building customer-facing forms, I can then focus on features rather than set-up.
  2. Comparing the enterprise form software with this software &#8211; the feature list is similar, but the new software is significantly more affordable.
  3. The documentation and tutorials are easy to read, which makes the training significantly easy. 
  4. The software has hundreds form templates so speed up development time.
  5. They have built-in integration with Zapier, WordPress, and Microsoft Flow. 
  6. That they have clients in local government, non-profits, restaurants, and sales.

Finally, note any solutions and unknowns.   
Using my Form software example &#8212; 

  1. I don&#8217;t know if the software will do what is promised, so I suggest a &#8216;trial period&#8217;, before completely rolling it out as a replacement.

<hr class="wp-block-separator" />

## STEP 3: You make the proposal. (I want this software… here&#8217;s why.)  


With the form software example: 

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <p>
    <br /> Hi [boss], <br />
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I&#8217;d like to make a proposal to use [FORM SOFTWARE]. It&#8217;s a drag-and-drop form editor that&#8217;s significantly faster than our enterprise form software. It&#8217;s a start-up that&#8217;s been in business for a few years, and have clients in local government, non-profits, restaurants, and sales.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I recommend using them because switching to this new form software means that I can do my work faster. Rather than wrestle with the old enterprise form software, I can implement the same functionality in this new software, and discover new features that can become future marketing strategies, &#8212; things like the &#8216;signature field&#8217; to sign contracts, and using the software in a kiosk setting for mobile forms. <em>[this is for my boss, so she can explain it to her boss]</em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Finally, it&#8217;s well documented. They have a &#8216;Get Started in 5 minutes&#8217; section to speed up anyone who wants to use it. They also have clear documentation on their API calls, as well as a sandbox, so the Ops team can integrate it fully into our system. Additionally, there&#8217;s also Zapier and WordPress plug-ins, so we can do some of the heavy lifting of integration ourselves.<em> [this is for my coworkers and the ops team who also need to use the system.] </em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Did I mention that it&#8217;s cheaper as a service? It&#8217;s a 1/10th of the price we are currently paying. I&#8217;m not exactly sure if this software can replace our Enterprise form software just yet &#8212; but after a few trials, I can report back to see if fits all of our needs. If so, that&#8217;s an opportunity to save $4,500 a YEAR. <em>[this is for the CFO, where I identified the cost value.]</em><br />
  </p>
</blockquote>

<hr class="wp-block-separator" />

## STEP 5: The decision-maker makes a much more informed decision. 

I&#8217;ve now crafted a much stronger case to the decision-maker to weed out any objections.   


The proposal may come off long &#8211; it&#8217;s a clear sign that you DID THE HOMEWORK. You didn&#8217;t just pass by a billboard and decided on this idea &#8211; you thought through all the stakeholders and implications.   


And with this level of research, they&#8217;ll have to work even harder to counter your process. 

<hr class="wp-block-separator" />

## In spite of this &#8211; it may not work

Even by following this process, it doesn&#8217;t mean success.  


There are three reasons for that:   


**1) You didn&#8217;t make a compelling reason.**   


Some times, you may think that you understand the motivation of your stakeholders.   


For the longest, I thought my CFO only cared about pinching pennies. When I saw her approve at an expensive software contract (when you can do the same thing with 3 platforms Frankenstein&#8217;d together), I saw that her motivation wasn&#8217;t about the CURRENT COST, it was about the FUTURE COSTS. It would be more expensive in the future to maintain a janky integration and provide support, rather than having a third-party manage all of it.

  
This is a learning process and will be something that you do for the rest of your life. Taking the time to understand people and what makes them tick will help you be more compelling in the future.  


**2) It&#8217;s not in the cards, there&#8217;s no alignment and you&#8217;re fighting an uphill battle**

I could do a 10-page essay about why having an unlimited beer in the breakroom could benefit the company and compare it to the offerings of Google and Airbnb.  


Going back to trade-offs &#8211; it just doesn&#8217;t look like a match. For start-ups, money is even more crunched. Each dollar needs to make ten, and if this isn&#8217;t making them money, they don&#8217;t want it.  


But also alignment. Trying to convince your law firm to have an unlimited beer because Google has that perk won&#8217;t get you anywhere. Google is a billion-dollar tech company. Your law firm… is not.  


**3) Timing**  


The last reason is that it&#8217;s just not the right time. You may never know what management is up to or what they have in store.   


An example:   
I proposed for the company to send me to a conference for additional training. I identified the stakeholders (My boss, the CEO, and the chief financial officer (CFO)), and had a value proposition for each person.  


**For my boss:** by attending this conference, I will be able to pass by some of the latest developments in the industry to the whole team, increasing our technical skill level.  


**For the CEO:** I informed him that I would be able to represent our company, and promised to make connections by attending lunches with our partners and being on the lookout for future clients.  


For **the CFO:** I compared the conference expenses with other training programs. I let her know that I&#8217;m open to absorbing some of the costs like food/travel. I was also willing to move the expense to next month, so it doesn&#8217;t eat into this month&#8217;s budget.

It was a pretty solid proposal. But they said those magic words &#8220;It&#8217;s not in the budget.&#8221;

After a major launch that generated a nice pile of revenue, my boss, proposed a few conferences I could attend, and he&#8217;ll vouch for me.   


A delayed win, but a win nevertheless!
