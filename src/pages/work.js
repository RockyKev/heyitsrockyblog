      </p>
      <p>
        Work included building all the Membership Sites and microsites, creating
        the wire framing and user experience, developing internal tools for data
        analysis, custom plugins for user tracking and integrations to pass data
        between all the various technologies we use. (Like
        Hubspot/Slack/Ultracart/WordPress/HelpScout/etc)
      </p>
      <p>
        As my developer advocate (avocado) role &#8211; I was &#8216;the
        guy&#8217; who translated the needs of the stakeholders into
        wireframing/spec docs/project timelines. I reviewed bug reports and
        feedback requests, and managed technical priorities.

      <p>
        I&#8217;ve also built apps for lead generation and provided in-person
        technical support at live Mirasee events, and attended some conferences
        representing Mirasee. I was selected because in spite of my technical
        background, I&#8217;m really cool to talk to!

        developing courses focused on business education.

      <p>
        This was a mix of graphic design, video editing, web development,
        student management, instructional design, data analysis, technical
        support, project management and a whole lot of personality, as I
        appeared in front of the webcam a LOT.

        My primary goal was to get students to course completion. Meaning,

        , as it was growing from two clubs to infinity. Online marketing in the
        late 2000s was a shotgun approach. I was part of the revolution of
        online marketing that focused on the customer&#8217;s wants and needs
        and trusting on analytical data to make marketing decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
        That finely-tuned approach of highly-targeted content marketing &amp;
        advertising on social media massively increased revenue and became a
        template for all online media campaigns for the company.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hungry for more experience in this wild west of online marketing, I
        provided consulting services &#8211; from small businesses like local
        coffee shops/legal firms, to even a national insurance company. (Which I
        won&#8217;t speak of &#8211; These old out-of-touch companies can die in
        a fire and be eaten up by hungry startups.)

        Teaching has always been my passion. Since high School failed me as a

        is given the tools to succeed.
